                            1. Collaborative filtering: The idea of this filtering is that if two users have similar rating history then they will behave similarly in the future. For example, consider there are two-person. One person liked the movie and rated the movie with a good score. Now, there is a good chance that the other person will also have a similar pattern and he/she will do the same thing that the first person has done.

                            2. Content-based filtering: The idea is to filter those videos which are similar to the video a user has liked before. Content-based filtering is highly dependent on the information from the products such as movie title, release year, actors, the genre. So to implement this filtering itâ€™s important to know the information describing each item and some sort of user profile describing what the user likes is also desirable.
